At first, create a `netlify.toml` file in the root of your repository and add the following configuration there:

```toml
[build]
command = "hugo --gc --minify"
publish = "public"

[context.production.environment]
HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"
HUGO_ENV           = "production"
HUGO_THEME         = "toha"
HUGO_VERSION       = "0.77.0"

[context.split1]
command = "hugo --gc --minify --enableGitInfo"

    [context.split1.environment]
    HUGO_ENV     = "production"
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.77.0"

[context.deploy-preview]
command = "hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

    [context.deploy-preview.environment]
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.77.0"

[context.branch-deploy]
command = "hugo --gc --minify -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

    [context.branch-deploy.environment]
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.77.0"

[context.next.environment]
HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"
```

1. Login into [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

5. Now, select the brach you want to deploy. Netlify should automatically populate the required field from the `netlify.toml` file we put in our repository. Just, press the `Deploy` button.

6. Now, wait for the deployment process to complete. Once, the site has been published, you can browse the site at the URL automatically generated by Netlify.

### Customize URL

You can customize URL of your site as below:

1. Click the `Domain Setting` button under `Site Overview` tab.

{{< img src="/posts/deploy-site/netlify/images/7.png" align="center" >}}

2. Now, you can either add your own domain by clicking on `Add custom domain` button or you can just use `<your custom prefix>.netlify.app` domain. Here, we are going to do the later. Click the `options` dropdown and select `Edit site name`.

3. Then give your site whatever name you want.

{{< img src="/posts/deploy-site/netlify/images/9.png" align="center" >}}

Now, you see the URL of your site has been updated. You can browse your site in the new URL.
